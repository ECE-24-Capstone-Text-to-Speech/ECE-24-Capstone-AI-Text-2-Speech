# Upload Instruction

Record your own voice or add from your device.

## How to submit?

Add files to the upload list, then press the `Upload` button to upload them to the server.

Once the files show up under `My samples`, they can be used for the TTS model.

### Record on here

1. Record a voice clip
2. Drag the audio player into the `drag-and-drop` area or press `Add` button.

### Source from device

1. Make sure your target file is _WAV_ file. (You **CANNOT** just change file extension. It **MUST** be encoded as _WAV_, or the program will not run!)
2. Drag the file from your file explorer into the `drag-and-drop` area or click the area and select it.
3. You can drag or select multiple files at once!

## File name change

If an file is in the upload list, press its name and you should be able to modify the file name.
