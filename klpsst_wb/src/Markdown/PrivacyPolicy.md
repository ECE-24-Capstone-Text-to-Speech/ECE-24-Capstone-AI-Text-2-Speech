# KLPSST Privacy Policy

At KLPSST, we are committed to protecting the privacy and security of our users' personal information. This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, and safeguard the data you provide when using our text-to-speech application with custom voice training capabilities.

## Information Collection and Use

### Personal Information

When you create an account with KLPSST, we collect personal information such as your name, email address, and any other details you provide during the registration process. This information is used solely to create and manage your account, as well as to communicate with you about our services.

### Voice Recordings

To enable the custom voice training feature, our application requires you to upload voice recordings. These recordings are used exclusively for the purpose of training the text-to-speech model to generate audio in your voice. The recordings are stored securely on our servers and are not shared with any third parties.

### Usage Data

We may collect non-personal information about how you interact with our application, such as the pages you visit, the features you use, and the actions you perform. This data is used to improve our services and provide a better user experience.

## Data Storage and Security

At KLPSST, we take the security of your personal information and voice recordings seriously. All data collected by our application is stored on secure servers with robust physical, administrative, and technical safeguards in place to prevent unauthorized access, disclosure, or misuse.

We implement industry-standard security measures, including encryption and access controls, to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of your data. However, no method of data transmission or storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

## User Responsibility

While we take every precaution to protect your data, we want to remind users that any information or voice recordings uploaded to our system are not guaranteed to be completely safe. We strongly advise against uploading any sensitive or confidential information that you do not wish to be potentially accessible to others.

## Data Retention and Deletion

We will retain your personal information and voice recordings for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide our services. If you choose to delete your account, your personal information and voice recordings will be permanently removed from our systems, subject to any legal obligations we may have to retain certain data.

## Changes to this Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
